# Artificial Super Intelligence Sandbox(ASISandBox)

## Overview
This project intends to create a unique sandbox environment for AI to grow in. It should have enough dynamic for complex emergent behavior without being so complex as to require too many parameters.

## Organization
An Agent can have multiple qualities, called Modifiers, which affect their behaviour, and may be inherited by their children. Fission can diminish an Agent's life according to a modifier, and the only way they can replenish their health is by consuming Cells, which can be other Agents or Objects. Health is slowly diminished according to a Modifier.
